This is a quick and dirty hack to get QUEUE working with JES2 5.1.0.

It is based on the old NERDC QUEUE command for JES2 2.2.0,
as modified by William B. Hecox to work with JES2 Version 4.

So far it seems to work with all releases of JES2 from JES2 5.2.0
up through OS/390 Release 4, and will probably work with later
releases of OS/390, since they are all supposed to coexist within
a MAS.

HOWEVER:  This assumes that you have not done a $ACTIVATE command.
If anyone runs this version of QUEUE against a $ACTIVATEd system,
please let me know via email how it worked.

The $JCLnnn members can be used as sample JCL to assemble and link
the program.  Please be careful of the RESTART option on the JOB card.
This is my working JCL, so sometimes I only assemble a single module.

There are probably problems with system affinities, especially with
system numbers greater than 7.

Please fix any problems you find, and then send the fixes to:

 - Frank Tompkins (TOMPKINS@VM1.CC.UAKRON.EDU) sent in a couple
   of fixes:
   - Member DDNAME needed to set QPDSID to X'FFFF' instead of '0000'
     to indicate an invalid dataset.
   - DS 0H was missing before the DEVTAB label in INIT.

 - Caller had a problem with QUEUE and JES2 4.3 because his JES2PARM
   specified a 4 character spool prefix, and QUEUE was written
   assuming a 5 character prefix.
   - Change INIT to pull the entire spool volser from DASVOLID.

 - Bill Horton sent in updates to allow QUEUE to run under ISPF.
   - Copy members QUEUEM2, QUEUEM3, QUEUEM4, and QUEUEM5 to a panel library.
   - Copy member QUECMDS to a TLIB library.
   - Add a line like the following to your ISPF primary panel:
         Q,'CMD(Q130)  NEWAPPL(QUE)  NOCHECK'
   - If you use a different value for NEWAPPL, you must also change the
     name of the QUECMDS member to match.
   - If you don't have QUECMDS defined, or if you invoke QUEUE via
     "TSO QUEUE", no PFK commands will be sent from ISPF to QUEUE.
