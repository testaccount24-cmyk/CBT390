 - Bill Horton sent in updates to allow QUEUE to run under ISPF.
   - Copy members QUEUEM2, QUEUEM3, QUEUEM4, and QUEUEM5 to a panel library.
   - Copy member QUECMDS to a TLIB library.
   - Add a line like the following to your ISPF primary panel:
         Q,'CMD(Q130)  NEWAPPL(QUE)  NOCHECK'
   - If you use a different value for NEWAPPL, you must also change the
     name of the QUECMDS member to match.
   - If you don't have QUECMDS defined, or if you invoke QUEUE via
     "TSO QUEUE", no PFK commands will be sent from ISPF to QUEUE.
