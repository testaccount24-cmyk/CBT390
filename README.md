//***FILE 390 is a JES2 5.2.0 version of QUEUE from Jack Schudel    *   FILE 390
//*           of NERDC at the University of Florida in Gainesville  *   FILE 390
//*           Florida.  This is his modification from the 4.3.0     *   FILE 390
//*           version on File 391, and Jack claims that it          *   FILE 390
//*           may need a tweaking here and there.                   *   FILE 390
//*                                                                 *   FILE 390
//*           However, Jack has done a lot of work on this version  *   FILE 390
//*           since he made that claim, and whatever source code    *   FILE 390
//*           was on his web site, is hereby presented also, in     *   FILE 390
//*           this file.                                            *   FILE 390
//*                                                                 *   FILE 390
//*           You may try and use this version of QUEUE for OS/390  *   FILE 390
//*           systems and at least early z/OS.                      *   FILE 390
//*                                                                 *   FILE 390
//*           Since the JES2 spool files for different versions     *   FILE 390
//*           are more compatible now, than they used to be, this   *   FILE 390
//*           version of QUEUE, if assembled against the JES2       *   FILE 390
//*           maclib, SYS1.version.SHASMAC for your current         *   FILE 390
//*           system, it might actually work for you.               *   FILE 390

//*           Added ISPF statistics to the members that didn't      *   FILE 390
//*           have them.  (SG - 09/2022)                            *   FILE 390
